Load the skill from: {{SKILL_PATH}}/git-commit-writer/SKILL.md

## Instructions

1. Analyze the staged changes using git commands
2. Check project conventions (AGENTS.md, README.md, recent commits)
3. Classify the change type (feat, fix, refactor, docs, style, test, chore, perf, security)
4. Generate a commit message following the rules in SKILL.md
5. Return ONLY the commit message, no commentary

## Commands to run

git diff --staged --stat
git diff --staged --name-only
